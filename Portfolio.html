            <h1>About Me </h1>

    

            <p>I, Tahmauri Bobo, am a future software engineer. 
            Throughout my life I have always had a great interest in computers, 
            programming, video games, and technology as a whole.

    <p>I am attending Medgar Evers College Preparatory School. 
    In school I am learning several different skills to help in my 
    future career. I have taken AP computer science while also teaching 
    myself some programming to sharpen my skills. I also am attending 
    the Brooklyn STEAM which is greatly helping me in my path to success.</p> 
    
    <p>I also have several hobbies of mine. One of the more dominant ones are video games. I am a huge fan of video games since they are fun, entertaining, and can even also be  educational. I plan on creating my own successful video game one day or even run a video game company. I also slightly enjoy drawing things, watching some movies and shows, and playing the piano.</p>
